## Migration Guide

### From v6.x to v7.0.0-local

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   \`\`\`bash
   # Remove
   OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
   
   # Add
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxx
   GROQ_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
   USE_TOOL_CALLING=true
   \`\`\`

2. **Update Dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Validate Configuration**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run setup:groq
   \`\`\`

4. **Run Tests**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Breaking Changes

- **API Provider**: OpenAI replaced with Groq
- **Model Format**: Different response formats may require prompt adjustments
- **Rate Limits**: Different rate limiting rules apply
- **Error Codes**: New error handling for Groq-specific errors

### Compatibility
